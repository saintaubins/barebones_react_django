python3 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate

pip install django

pip install djangorestframework

django-admin startproject myproject

cd to myproject -> settings.py -> INSTALLED_APPS and input 'rest_framework',

go into myproject directory and type the following.

python manage.py startapp webapp

go back to settings.py and insert name of the project 'webapp',

then create a model in models.py, use employee as reference.

go to admin.py, add the model, and register the site.

once registered run migrations, python manage.py makemigrations, python manage.py migrate

create a superuser, python manage.py createsuperuser.

check to see server is running, python manage.py runserver.

go to admin page, localhost:8000/admin, verify table, users, groups, everything is there.

in this case add a few employees manually.

next we will create a serilizer class, to convert the sql to json.

we will create a new file in the webapp called serializers.py

see the two imports in the headers!

Note the the employee class and how it is an output.

Next to to views.py and design there are many inputs in the header.

then after the headers, create a class based view see viewss.py

go to urls.py and add the imports, and the urlpatterns, see urls.py in main project.

go thru the files as needed to fix bugs.

you should be able to compile, and see 'employee/' onsite1

all set for get requests to an API, with Django!

cannot hit from the front yet, tried 'ALLOWED_HOSTS', and not the issue.

added CORS Origin Whitelist, but only part of the issue, need to get cors package.

added middleware cors headers, then ran 'pip install django-cors-headers'admin.py

can now see json in the console.log from the front. woo hoo!!!
